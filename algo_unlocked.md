# 📝Description

**Xplore VJTI** is the very important project not just for its developers but also for everyone who want to avail a detailed knowledge about one of the premium engineering institute of the nation - **VEERMATA JIJABAI TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE (VJTI).** 
The **difficulties** faced by us in our initial phase of college life, gave us a **strong motivation** to develop this application for the coming generations and all the concerned peoples. 
Now in the further discussion, all the features being implimented will be briefly described in features.

<!-- Add your **project description** here. Your project description should cover how your website/app works. That way you can convey what your project is without the need for anyone to view the code. A more *detailed README* in your project repository is encouraged, which can include build and use instructions etc. -->


# Features
## 1. LOGIN & SIGN-UP

   For all the new users to our app, we have a login/sign-up options for both - VJTI as well as non-VJTI users - where we collect few basic information of the user - Name, DOB, Email id, Registeration Number, Branch and Password - and store them to the firebase along with their encrypted credentials. The email authentication is also done using the features of firebase.

## 2. DASHBOARD

   After successful registeration and login, the user is carried to the dashboard which is the main soul of the project. All the features of the app can be accessed through the dashboard. We have a pallete view having seven thumbnails which are as follows:
   
   - **Senior's Advice:**
     It is a common chatbox where everyone can post their doubts and queries as well as it also provides an interface for seniors to resolve those queries. Additionally, the developers are given an admin tag who can control the chats and maintain its decorum.
   
   - **Extra-Curriculars:**
     It is the most attractive site of our app especially for the aspiring students. Here one can find a list of all clubs & committees of VJTI and on clicking them one can land to the official website of that particular club/committee. So it basically reflects the beauty of the extra-curriculars in VJTI which covers the taste of all its students ranging from various technical and cultural interests.
   
   - **Notes & PYQs:**
     It is the flagship feature of this app which enables user to contribute our college community with some helpful notes & pyqs from the subject toppers which prove to be a key factor for any student to succeed in exams. Additionally, it would also help in building the spirit of contribution which eventually hepls lifetime.  
   
   - **About VJTI:**
     As the title suggests, this feature contains all the general information about VJTI which is simply copy pasted from the official website and very well arranged here especially for the prospeactive students.  
   
   - **Location within the campus:**
     It's the most fancy, difficult to impliment and extremely needful feature of this app. The hardships that we faced in the initial days of our college, in search of various landmarks inside this widely spread college was very painful and thus we came across this idea to make such a feature which would help coming generations as well as the existing students to find the best suitable path from A to B. As said earlier, its the most difficult part to impliment, so for now we have directly merged an app created by our seniors from 2023 batch - Mr Ravi Maurya & Ms Sarah Tisekar - with the name "VJTI Maps".
   
   - **How to get VJTI:**
     As per the name of this title, it is all about the various eligibilty criterias and the previous year cut-offs for every branch along with few free advices from the topper. In short, it is the most statistical page of this app and extremely helpful for anyone to gain a very clear idea regarding the various eligibility criterias of VJTI.
   
   - **Map of VJTI:**
     It is a simpler alternative for locations within the campus wherein we have a schematic map of VJTI along with few markings of famous lankdmarks, which may help user to locate it and reach there according to his preferable way.

## 3. SIDE BAR
Side bar is the most appropriate place for user to access its profile and to customize the app as per his/her need. Additionally, it is also the place where, a user can contact the developers in case of any feedback or suggestion. So in this app too, we tried to implement these features and the following is a breif description of each one of them:

- **View Profile:**
In this feature, the user can access his/her profile as entered during the signup. It also enables the user to update his/her profile and make appropriate changes as and when required.

- **Share App**
It is the most common feature of all the major apps and thus we also added this feature. Here when the user clicks on it, the pop-message comes up which allows to share the link of the app through various means.

- **Contact Us:**
It is the feature which connects the user with the app developers and also an email id is provided there which can be used to send us any suggestions/feedback for the app. Additionally, a special note for the developers of "VJTI Maps" has been written without whom the location within the campus could not be implemented.

- **Log out:**
This button facilitates user to sign off his/her account from the app. So when that particular user wants to access the app, he/she needs to sign in again. Thus protecting the data of the users in case of any long break from the app usage. 

Now in the subsequent points, the major features among the above list are described further.

## 4. SENIOR'S ADVICE
It is the most interactive feature of this app wherein the user can interact with each other and can effectively make use of the experiances of each other in the college. Here we have assured that the students of every year can gain the benifits of this feature. Since the students across various years and branches are all together in this chatbox, a healthy environment fillied with diverity can help users to ask/solve the doubts and queries of each other and subsequently, strengthening the bond among each other. Also this chatbox can be used for the promotion of various events conducted by various clubs/committees in the college. And finally, to maintain the decorum of the chatbox, the admins would be given a special access to control all the messages. 

## 5. NOTES & PYQs
As said earlier, it is the flagship feature of this app which is inspired from the healthy spirit of contribution. In this section, the user can share notes & pyqs which are available with him to the open community of VJTI. It becomes extremely helpful at the exam times to have a quick recap of the  This will immensely popularize the app among the various kinds of user.
