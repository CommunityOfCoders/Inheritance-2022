 Want access to our library? Then here's a convenient way to do so... Our website allows students to access the library just sitting at their place.  
<br><br>
   
 <----SECTIONS--->
      
-  1. Student Section:-<br>
      The student section is where a new student can register when he/she enters VJTI. After a student is registered he/she can simply login next time. We have a very secured validation system which only allows students with VJTI e-mail IDs to register as well as login. 
 <br>
     The <i>key features</i>:
      <ul>
        <li> All books: Students can see all the books available in library. They can even search for a book.
          <li> Issue book:If the desired book is found student can issue it and then the book belongs to him for a particular period of time. Student cannot issue more than a particular number of books at a time.
            <li> Waiting list: Supposing the book that the student is looking for is not available, then the user can add his name to the waiting list. He/she can also see the number of people already present in the waiting list for that book. If he/she is the first person in the waiting list, once the book is returned back to library, they receive a mail and only they can issue that book.
            <li>While going through the books if you find an important one and don't want to forget it then don't worry, you can simply add it to your wishlist.
            <li>Request book: If the book your searching for is not present in the library then you can request it, or if some one has already requested it you can simply like it and show your interest.
            <li>Book Bank: Books from the book bank can also be viewed and issued by students.
      </ul>
      
      <br>

## 🌟Progress
All the fully implemented features in our project: 
1. All the books available in the library can be viewed along with the total number of copies and available number of copies
2. If the book is available, it can be issued; if not, the student can add his/her name to the waiting list. The number of people already there in the waiting list can be viewed by the student. The waiting list of every book can be viewed by the librarian.
3. A student can add a book to his/her wishlist
4. All the requested books are visible to the student and librarian. A student can ‘like’ a book if he/she wishes for it to be in the library. He/she can also request for a new book. The librarian can see all the requested books according to their popularity.
5. E-mails are sent to a student when his/her due date is near, if the due date is crossed or when a book is available for issuing.
6. A student who hasn’t returned a book 14 days after it has been due will be blacklisted and cannot issue any more books until the previous ones have been returned.
