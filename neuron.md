## 📝Description
Intelligent Navigesture is an ML-baseds project which helps the user to have a touchless experience through gestures interaction with the interface and thus experience the following :
-	Touchless mouse: This helps the user to navigate through the interface
-	Volume control: Contactless controlling of volume through hand signs
-	Ping pong game: A fun experience where the user can play the classic ping pong game with his two hands without needing a companion.

## 🤖Tech-Stack
Computer Vision :

•	OpenCV 

•	Python programming language


Deep Learning :

•	Neural networks and model training


## 📈Progress
1) Gesture based mouse control is working with functionalities - left click, right click , scroll , drag and drop
2) Volumn control via gestures is also working
3) A webmodule is added that can open a website using gestures
4) A ping pong can be played in real-time using gestures by two people.

## 🔮Future Scope
1) Current code only uses cpu to function. Trying to find ways to use gpu power to get better results
2) Building and training a model that can train on user-inputed gestures and control the operating system based on those gestures.


## 💸Applications
Hand tracking can be used as an alternative input method for controlling a mouse on a computer. Here are some potential usage scenarios for hand tracking in this context:

1.	Virtual and Augmented Reality: Hand tracking will likely play a larger role in the development of virtual and augmented reality technologies, providing users with     more intuitive and natural ways to interact with virtual objects and environments.
2.	Accessibility: Hand tracking can provide a more accessible option for individuals with disabilities that make it difficult to use a traditional mouse.
3.	Gaming: In gaming, hand tracking can provide a more immersive experience by allowing players to control the game using hand gestures.
4.	Health-Care: Can be use in an environment where it is not viable to physical touch is needed to operate machines , for example- surgery.
5.	Presentations: In presentations, hand tracking can be used to interact with slides, providing a more dynamic and engaging experience for the audience.
