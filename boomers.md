## 📝Description

Nearly 150 million people in India needed interventions, where the low and middle class faced more burden than the well-off people. This project is an attempt to make mental health more accessible. Our website is designed to help improve the mental well-being of users. With features like a mental health questionnaire, we aim to break the stigma surrounding mental health and provide solutions to help improve their mental state. Mental health has long been a taboo topic, but we aim to change that by offering a safe and supportive space for individuals to seek help and guidance. Our ML-based chatbot is available for conversation and provides information and support on mental illnesses and how to deal with them. After taking the questionnaire, users are directed to a tailored solution specific to their mental health needs, with a detailed plan available on the website for all to view.
  
**Key Features:**
1. Questionnaire:
Our questionnaire feature includes 5 clinically approved assessments for measuring levels of anger, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and sleep disorders. These questionnaires are widely used by medical professionals worldwide. Each quiz consists of a series of questions with 4 answer options. The results will indicate the severity of the condition, ranging from mild to severe. Once the questionnaire is completed, users will have the option to view solutions for their specific results.

2. Chatbot:
Introducing our AI-powered chatbot feature, designed to provide support and guidance on mental health issues. This retrieval-based chatbot utilizes machine learning algorithms to mimic a therapist-like conversation and provide solutions to basic questions on mental health, mental illness, and related topics. Despite being a base-level chatbot, its conversational abilities make it a valuable resource for those seeking support in navigating their mental health journey. With a shortage of medical professionals available to address mental health concerns, our chatbot can help alleviate some of the burden, although it is important to note that severe cases should still be addressed by a licensed doctor.

## 💸Applications

Our project addresses a critical issue of limited access to mental health resources, particularly for those in low and middle-income communities in India. Our platform aims to provide a safe and supportive space for individuals to take control of their mental well-being and improve their mental state. Our key features of the mental health questionnaire and AI-powered chatbot provide users with tailored solutions specific to their mental health needs and support through a conversational interface.

This project has several possible real-life applications, including:

1.Breaking the stigma surrounding mental health: By offering a supportive and non-judgmental platform for mental health support, we aim to normalize the conversation around mental health and encourage individuals to take control of their mental well-being.

2.Providing support for mental health: Our platform provides a wide range of resources and support for mental health, from questionnaires to conversational support from the AI-powered chatbot.

3.Reducing the burden on medical professionals: The shortage of medical professionals available to address mental health concerns can be alleviated with the use of our chatbot, which can provide support for basic mental health needs and direct severe cases to licensed doctors.

In terms of monetization, there are several potential revenue streams, including:

1.Advertising: Our platform could generate revenue through targeted advertising to mental health service providers or pharmaceutical companies.

2.Premium subscriptions: Users could access additional resources and support through premium subscriptions, providing additional revenue for the platform.

Overall, our project has the potential to make a significant impact in the lives of those struggling with mental health, while also providing a valuable service with monetization potential.
