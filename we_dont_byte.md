## 📝Description

An attempt to bring together animal lovers
Forging new lives for Mumbai's forgotten animals

The number of stray animals in Mumbai is currently over 2,50,000, out of which only 90,000 have been neutered since 2016. With little to no effort from the BMC, the work of rescuing and caring for stray animals has become more expensive and harder to manage for animal activists.

Our site stimulates co-operation between the users and the NGOs that are dedicated to the rescue and rehabilitation of stray and abandoned animals.

1. Users send SOS forms.
2. NGOs receive those forms and can help the stray animals.
3. Pet lovers post their pets on pawstagram and view others' cute pet posts.
4. A community of animal lovers and NGOs that are dedicated towards helping the abandoned animals of Mumbai.
